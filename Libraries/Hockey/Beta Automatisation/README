Note:
This script does not work right out of the box, you have to modify it to work correctly. It's just a source of inspiration!

What the script does:
¥ It checks whether the current build is for the device
¥ It moves the .app and .app.dSYM files to a secure location you specify
¥ It archives the .app file into .ipa file, just like Xcode's "Build and Archive"
¥ It moved the archived .ipa file to your Dropbox folder, so beta testers can easily access it
¥ It generates the .plist file required for wireless app distribution
¥ It uploads the archived .ipa file and the generated .plist file to your ftp server using Terminal

How you set it up:
¥ In your Xcode project you have to add a new "Aggregate" target
¥ Then you add your main target to that added target's dependencies
¥ After that you need to a new "Run Script" build phase and paste in your modified script
