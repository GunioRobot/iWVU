 *    KalGridView
 *    ------------------
 *
 *    Private interface
 *
 *  As a client of the Kal system you should not need to use this class directly
 *  (it is managed by KalView).
 *
 *  Each |cell| is a UIView, and each cell's width is the full width of the KalGridView.
 *  In other words, the cell represents a week in the calendar.
 *  One cell (week) can optionally be kept on-screen by the slide animation, depending
 *  on whether the currently selected month has a partial week that belongs to the month
 *  that will be slid into place.
