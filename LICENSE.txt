Main Screen Icons

Based on existing work by Joseph Wain:

You are free to share it and to remix it remix under the following conditions:

* You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor 
(but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work).
* For any reuse or distribution, you must make clear to others the license terms 
of this work. The best way to do this is with a link to 
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/
* Any of the above conditions can be waived if you get permission from the 
copyright holder (send me an email!).
* Apart from the remix rights granted under this license, nothing in this license 
impairs or restricts the author's moral rights.

ATTRIBUTION -- a note reading "icons by Joseph Wain / glyphish.com" or similar, plus 
a link back to glyphish.com from your app's website, is the preferred form of attribution.
Also acceptable would be, like, a link from within your iPhone application, or from the 
iTunes store page, but those aren't as useful to other people. If none of these work for 
you, please contact hello@glyphish.com and we can work something out.

USE WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION -- If attribution is not possible, workable or desirable for your 
application, contact hello@glyphish.com for commercial non-attributed licensing terms.
